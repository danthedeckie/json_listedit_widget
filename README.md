# JSON Sortable List Widget

Turn a textarea with JSON data in it into a sortable (by drag/drop) editable
list that keeps the text area updated as values / order / content changes.

Early demo version.

Intended for use in a POS / invoice system where we want an invoice / order
to be made up, with items, quantity, etc. But also allow sections (headers)
notes (freeform text) subtotals, and non-database items, so coming up with a
pure relational DB model/metamodel/links/thing would become overly complex
and fragile.

Additional uses, which is why I'm trying to keep it more generic, would include
a flat menu/footer editor, a 'Sir Trevor' structured content alike editor, and so on.
